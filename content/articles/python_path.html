Discover list comprehensions
Discover generators
Incorporate map, reduce, filter, iter, range, xrange often into your code
Discover Decorators
Write recursive functions, a lot
Discover itertools and functools
Read Real World Haskell (read free online)
Rewrite all your old Python code with tons of higher order functions, recursion, and whatnot.
Annoy your cubicle mates every time they present you with a Python class. Claim it could be "better" implemented as a dictionary plus some functions. Embrace functional programming.
Rediscover the Strategy pattern and then all those things from imperative code you tried so hard to forget after Haskell.
Find a balance.
