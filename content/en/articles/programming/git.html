      So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important section to
      absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals
      of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much
      easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the
      things you may know about other VCSs, such as CVS, Subversion or
      Perforce — doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when
      using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar
      to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a
      very different way, and understanding these differences will help
      you avoid becoming confused while using it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and
      friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually,
      most other systems store information as a list of file-based
      changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and
      so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the
      changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as
      delta-based version control).
    </p>

    <p>
      Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git
      thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a
      miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save
      the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what
      all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference
      to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed,
      Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous
      identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data
      more like a stream of snapshots.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>Nearly Every Operation Is Local</h3>
      Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to
      operate — generally no information is needed from another
      computer on your network. If you’re used to a CVCS where most
      operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of
      Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git
      with unworldly powers. Because you have the entire history of
      the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem
      almost instantaneous.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>Git Has Integrity</h3>
      Everything in Git is checksummed before it is stored and is then
      referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to
      change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing
      about it. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest
      levels and is integral to its philosophy. You can’t lose
      information in transit or get file corruption without Git being
      able to detect it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <h3>The Three States</h3>
      Pay attention now — here is the main thing to remember about Git
      if you want the rest of your learning process to go
      smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside
      in: committed, modified, and staged:

      Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local
      database.

      Modified means that you have changed the file but have not
      committed it to your database yet.

      Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current
      version to go into your next commit snapshot.
